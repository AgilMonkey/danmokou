stage1,"The original stage 1 theme was too metal for a lot of listeners, so we remade it with a much calmer instrument palette.",,
stage1boss,"Kasen, as both an oni and a hermit, combines both an aggressive guitar and folk instruments in the form of a koto and a shakuhachi.",,
stage2,"We wanted this theme to reflect Yukari-- laid-back, but also vaguely threatening.",,
stage2boss,"Marisa doesn't show up in this game, but we had to show off the rainbow lasers somehow, so we gave them all to Kaguya.",,
stage3,"This theme communicates a real sense of danger, as if to warn you of a CAVE-style stage 3 difficulty spike. In fact, in SiMP v1, the stage was upside-down, and you had to dodge at the top of the screen and collect items falling upwards. It was probably a bit too extreme of a difficulty spike. ",,
stage3boss,"Seija is a character who lives on dualities: left and right, up and down, red and blue, fast and slow. As people don't seem to particularly enjoy the camera flipping gimmick, we ended up focusing on those last two. ",,
stage4boss,"Mima, as a self-proclaimed celestial god, themes all her cards around astronomy-- to a perhaps excessively literal extent in 'Where Fallen Stars Come to Rest' and 'Temporality Consumed by its Progeny'.

Mechanically, though, her style is more about dumping large numbers of bullets on screen. Each bullet follows a simple enough path on its own, but overlap enough of them and you get terrifying structures like in 'The Andromeda Revolving'. In this respect, you might find her harder than the final boss, because 'figuring out' her cards won't help you very much in dodging the sheer number of bullets.

The dual-boss section with Keine and Kaguya was inspired by AJS' dual-boss scripts. The nonspells are, mechanically speaking, fairly similar to the cards from Imperishable Night they were based on. The spells, though, are more choreographed anime fights.",,

stageex,"You may not have noticed, but this theme is also a flamenco.",,
stageexboss,"Shinki is the only boss in the game who has proper nonspells, in the form of her 'Unnamed Card's. For better or for worse, most other nonspells in this game aren't particularly mechanically distinguishable from spells.

If Mima is structured around large numbers of simple bullets, and Reimu is structured around small numbers of complex bullets, then Shinki is the most dangerous of both. Her spells fill the screen with large numbers of strange bullets-- whether that be the dodgeball game of 'No Creation, No Destruction' or the grid structures of 'No Defilement, No Purity' or the hamster wheels of 'No Growth, No Reduction'-- many of which might also be pulsating in size as they approach.
