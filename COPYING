Danmokou is a danmaku (bullet hell) engine built in C# for Unity. It is free (as in free speech) software. The source code is on Github: https://github.com/Bagoum/danmokou

All source code, including script files, in this project is distributed under the GNU GPL v3 or any later version. Some non-code resources are distributed under CC BY 4. See the Licenses folder for copies, or visit https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html and https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ .

The Licenses folder also contains licenses for the following packages used by this project:
Easing Equations by C.J. Kimberlin and Robert Penner
Hash Without Sine by David Hoskins
Newtonsoft.Json by Kalle Jillheden
Some files from these projects exists in the source code. Those files have the original licenses at the top for convenience. 

Code is present primarily under the directories FS, Assets/Plugins/Self, Assets/Rendering/Shaders, Assets/CG, Assets/UXML (normal code), as well as Assets/Patterns and Assets/SiMP/Scripts (script files).
Present dialogue files (Assets/SiMP/Dialogue/Scripts) are not considered code. They may be used under CC BY 4.
This project also includes other assets such as images and audio. Many of these assets are not by me. See below for details.

To clarify on your obligations under the GPL (IANAL): Modifications, additions, or extensions (including incorporating these modules into a larger project) made to the C#/F# engine, shaders, UXML, etc. must also be distributed under the terms of the GPL. However, if you make your own pattern scripts and use this engine to run them, you may license those scripts as you like. 

This said, I would encourage you to publicly publish your pattern scripts as well in the spirit of community danmaku. 

The directory Assets/Plugins/Self/Core/FS contains compiled binaries of the directory FS.
